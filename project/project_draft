Script to distribute "Herwig" runs on computers

- Use a specified version of Herwig
- Build needed analyses?
- Read Herwig for all runs with the same in-file, copy the Herwig-scratch directory + the run file to all run folders
- Run Herwig on the cores that were specified
- Print info about how it went, so it's easy to see how many runs ended up being done
- Merge the yoda files
- maybe do some rivet-mkhtml
- clean up
- check log-files for errors?
- check for errors both in the log files after runs and during the read step
- ctrl-c should send an interrupt signal to Herwig on all of the nodes, and not do what it currently is
